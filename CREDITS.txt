Lots of thanks to the following people:

  * Forskerfabrikken (Scientist Factory) and Omid Mirmotahari for
    using Basus for educational purposes (very inspiring!)

  * Jon S. Bratseth, Gabriel B. Stav, Glenn T. Lines and Kjetil
    Valstadsve for contributing sample code.

  * Kjetil Østerås for fixing bugs, providing support for changing
    theme (look & feel), translating help pages to Norwegian, and for
    correcting mistakes in the English help pages.  Major contributor!
