basus
=====

I'm not ready to make this totally public yet, so here are just a few
notes to whoever happens to pass by:

  * I started restructuring stuff about a year ago, without ever
    coming around to finish it.  Some stuff may be in illogical
    locations.

  * Uses other jar files from your's truly.  All of them should be
    pulled automatically from my maven repo.  If not, please let me
    know.

  * I really never intended this to be a collaboration project, so
    there is no developer documentation.

  * Staring point for launching the IDE: no.shhsoft.basus.Main

  * Build and run from command line:

        mvn clean package
        java -jar full/target/basus-1.3-SNAPSHOT.jar


Sverre.
