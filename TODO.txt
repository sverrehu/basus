Bugs

Short term
  * "Back" in the help browser should remember the scrollbar position
  * Translate help to Norwegian.
  * Fix TODOs.
  * When returning to the IDE from full-screen mode, copy sprites as
    well.
  * When running outside IDE (applet, window, fullscreen): Error
    messages should appear in the output window.  Make sure background
    and foreground are reasonable.

Long term
  * Graphical texts (set font, location, ...).
  * Sound.
  * Debugging.

Probably never
  * Clean up the bloody GUI code.  My GUI code is always a mess.
  * Run program as a screen saver (screensavers.dev.java.net).
  * Make Basus-programs run on mobile phones (major task).
      * Need to get rid of lots of classes to reduce the size.
      * Basus programs should probably be precompiled to some format
        so that the compiler classes may be left out.  (Serializable
        is not supported, so the precompiled format cannot rely on
        (Java-style) serialized syntax trees.)
      * Decide what to do about floating point expressions/functions.
        Real FP requires CLDC 1.1, which I suspect is not widely
        available.  (There appears to be FP-simulating code
        available.)
      * Thread.interrupt is not supported.  May not be an issue,
        although the BasusRunner uses it to terminate a running
        program.
