<h1>color</h1>

<p>Sets the color that will be used for the next printing or drawing
operation.</p>

<p>This function expects three or four integers between 0 and 255 to
specify the color.  The first three specify the color components, the
optional fourth specifies the alpha value (opacity).  The first
number indicates how much of the color red to add.  The second is for
green, and the third is for blue.  Zero indicates nothing of the
corresponding color component, while 255 indicates "as much as
possible".
</p>

<p>Think of the values as how much coloured light to add for each of
the red, green and blue color components.  To have black, you wouldn't
add any light at all.  Black is thus represented
by <span class="code">(0, 0, 0)</span>.  To have white, you would add
all colours at max: <span class="color">(255, 255, 255)</span>.  You
could mix red and blue to have magenta: <span class="code">(255, 0,
255)</span>.  A more red magenta would appear if you didn't add that
much blue: <span class="color">(255, 0, 200)</span>.</p>

<p>The alpha value indicates the level of opacity for the color.  A
value of 0 indicates that the color should be fully transparent.  A
value of 255 indicates that it should be opaque (solid).  The default
alpha value is 255.</p>
