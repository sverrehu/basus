<h1>println</h1>

<p>Prints some text, and moves to the beginning of the next line.  Any
text printed after a call to <span class="code">println</span>, will
thus appear below.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This function takes zero or more arguments.</p>
<pre>
    println();
</pre>

<p>When called without arguments, it just moves to the next line
without printing anything.</p>

<p>If one or more arguments are given, each one printed sequentially
before advancing to the next line.  Examples of usage:</p>

<pre>
    println(value);
    println("text");
    println("value of PI: ", PI);
</pre>
