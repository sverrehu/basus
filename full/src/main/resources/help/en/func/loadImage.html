<h1>loadImage</h1>

<p>Loads an image from a file, given by a string filename.</p>

<p>Filenames are relative to the location of the Basus program that
loads them, so the images must be located in the same directory as the
basus program, or in a sub-directory.</p>

<p>Note that since the filename is relative to the location of the
program, you cannot load an image unless you have first saved your
program text somewhere.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre>
    image1 = loadImage("background.png");
    image2 = loadImage("pictures/picture1.jpg");
</pre>
