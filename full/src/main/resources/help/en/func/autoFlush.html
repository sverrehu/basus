<h1>autoFlush</h1>

<p>Enables or disables immediate display updates for all functions
that prints or draws anything.  By
default, <span class="code">autoFlush</span> is enabled.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, every single call to functions that update the
display first updates an internal image, and then flushes this image
to the display.  When you do animations, this flushing for every
single drawing operation may lead to flicker.  In such cases, you may
want to disable the automatic flushing, and take care of the flushing
yourself: Call <span class="code">autoFlush(FALSE)</span>, do all the
drawing you want in a single animation step, and call
<a href="func/flush">flush</a> to have everything displayed.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre>
    autoFlush(FALSE);
    autoFlush(TRUE);
