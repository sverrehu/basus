<h1>Embedding a Basus Program in a Web Page</h1>

<p>In order to embed a Basus program in a web page, you will need to
upload the Basus jar file, your Basus program and any images it loads
to a directory of the web server.  Then create an index.html (or
default.htm if running on a Microsoft web server) in the same
directory, and let it contain the following where you want the program
to be included:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;applet archive="basus-1.0.jar"
            code="no.shhsoft.basus.ui.BasusApplet.class"
            width="640" height="480"&gt;
        &lt;param name="program" value="name-of-the-program.bus"/&gt;
        Your browser does not support the applet tag.
    &lt;/applet&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note that the value of the archive attribute should be the name of
the Basus jar file you uploaded.  The value attribute of the program
param should be the name of your Basus program file.</p>

<p>When everything is in place, just visit the web page you just
created in a Java enabled browser, and enjoy.</p>
