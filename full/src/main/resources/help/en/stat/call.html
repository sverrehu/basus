<h1>Function calls</h1>
<p>Functions are blocks of code that may be invoked by
issuing a function call.  When a function call is performed,
the code within the function is executed.  When the function has
finished doing its job, control is returned to the statement
following the function call.</p>

<p>There are several <a href="functions">built-in functions</a> to
call.  Additionally, one may <a href="stat/function">define new
functions</a>.</p>

<p>Some functions return a value that may be used as part
of an expression.  Other functions do not return any value.
Returned values may nevertheless be ignored.</p>

<p>Functions may take zero or more arguments on which they
operate.  The arguments passed to a function must have the
correct data types as expected by the invoked function.</p>

<p>All data types except arrays are <i>passed by value</i> to
the called function.  This means that the function cannot change
the value of its arguments.  Arrays, however,  are passed
<i>by reference</i>, so any changes done to array elements
will be visible to the caller of the function.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>A function call is performed using the name of the function
followed by a (possibly empty) list of arguments in parenthesis.</p>
<pre>
    <span class="pseudo">function-name</span>(<span class="pseudo">variable-list</span>);
</pre>

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>
    println("Hello!");
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
    charCode = readChar();
</pre>
