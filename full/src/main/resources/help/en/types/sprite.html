<h1>Sprite Data Type</h1>

<p>Sprites are images that may be moved around independently of what's
on the screen; thay appear to float in front of whatever has been
drawn using other graphic functions.</p>

<p>A sprite is created by converting
an <a href="types/image">image</a> to a sprite using
the <a href="func/toSprite">toSprite</a> function.</p>

<p>In order for the sprite to be shown, it must be made visible using
the <a href="func/spriteVisible">spriteVisible</a> function and moved
to a location on screen
using <a href="func/spriteMove">spriteMove</a>.  The location of a
sprite may be queried using the <a href="func/spriteX">spriteX and
spriteY</a> functions, and it's size may be queried
using <a href="func/width">width</a>
and <a href="func/height">height</a>.</p>

<p>If multiple sprites are present, you may control which are in front
of which by adjusting a depth property using
the <a href="func/spriteDepth">spriteDepth</a> function.  By default,
the depth is zero (0), which is closer to the viewer.  Setting the
depth to higher numbers moves the sprite closer to the background.
Sprites with lower depth numbers will appear to pass in front of sprites
with higher depth numbers.</p>

<p>You may check for collision between any two sprites using
the <a href="func/spriteCollision">spriteCollision</a> function.  A
sprite must be visible in order be collidable.</p>
