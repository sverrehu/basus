<h1>String Data Type</h1>

<p>Strings are text, made up of arrays of characters.  String
constants may be made up of text enclosed in double quotes ("").</p>

<p>Inside a string constant, backslash is used to <i>escape</i>
characters that may have special meaning, and characters that may not
be easily represented by themselves.  Prime example of escaping: Since
double quote is used as a marker for the start and the end of a text
string, how would you represent that double quote character inside the
text?  The answer is to escape it with a backslash.  The following
string constant</p>

<pre>
    "She said \"ouch!\""
</pre>

<p>would be interpreted as the string</p>

<pre>
    She said "ouch!"
</pre>

The backslash may be used to encode other characters as well.  The
following table describes valid escapes in Basus:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>\b</td>
    <td>Backspace, ASCII 8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\t</td>
    <td>Horizontal tab, ASCII 9</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\n</td>
    <td>Line feed, ASCII 10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\r</td>
    <td>Carriage return, ASCII 13</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\\</td>
    <td>Backslash</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Backslash followed by any other character will represent the
following character itself.  As seen in the table above, this means
that a backslash character inside a string must be represented by two
consecutive backslashes.</p>
