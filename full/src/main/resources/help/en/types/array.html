<h1>Array Data Type</h1>

<a>Arrays are numbered lists of values.  One may address individual
values in the list by <i>indexing</i>.  If the
variable <span class="code">arr</span> is an array, one may reference
the fifth element by using five as an index in square brackets, like
this:</p>
<pre>
    fifthElement = arr[5];
</pre>

<p>Note that it is illegal to refer to an array element that has not
been given a value.</p>

<p>In Basus, arrays automatically extend as values are added to them.
Assigning values to array items is done by indexing with an array as
the left hand side of the assignment:</p>
<pre>
    arr[5] = "foo";
</pre>

<p>The function <a href="func/maxIndex">maxIndex</a> will return the
highest valid index for an array, in other words the highest index
that has been assigned a value.  This may be used for looping over
array elements, like this:</p>
<pre>
    for index = 1 to maxIndex(arr) do
        println(arr[index]);
    done;
</pre>

<p>Note that Basus doesn't set any rules for what the first index of
an array should be.  In some languages arrays are indexed from one.
In others they are indexed from zero.  In Basus, you may pick any
value for the start index, depending on personal preferences and what
best matches what you intend to do.</p>

<p>The individual values of an array may have any type, including
arrays.  All the following statements are valid:
</p>
<pre>
    arr[1] = 42;
    arr[2] = 3.14;
    arr[3] = TRUE;
    arr[4] = "Basus";

    other_arr[1] = arr;
</pre>

<p>Note how the last statement above assigns
the <span class="code">arr</span> array to the first element of
the <span class="code">other_arr</span> array.  The latter array thus
becomes a <i>multi-dimensional array</i>.  Given a multi-dimensional
array, you may index into underlying arrays by listing several indexes
in square brackets, separated by commas.  Based on the assignments
above, the following would print <tt>Basus</tt>:</p>
<pre>
    println(other_arr[1, 4]);
</pre>

<p>This would change the fourth value of
  the <span class="code">arr</span> array to <tt>foo</tt> by indexing
  through the <span class="code">other_arr</span> array:
</p>
<pre>
    other_arr[1, 4] = "foo";
</pre>
