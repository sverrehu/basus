<h1>Idéen Bak Basus</h1>

<p>For å forstå tanken bak Basus må man vite litt om meg, Sverre,
forfatteren av Basus. Jeg ble født i 1968 i Norge. Som søn av en ham
radio operatør (LA3YU) ble jeg oppdratt med lukten av loddetinn i
nesa. På tidlig 1980 tallet så kjøpte min gud-lignende (for meg)
tekno-pappa et ZX-81 byggesett og satt det sammen. Det var den første
rimelige datamaskinen til hjemmebruk. Ren magi. Til tross for sin
gud-lignende forståelse av teknology så klarte ikke faren min å laste
et program fra tape spilleren. Men det klarte jeg ved å fin justere
volum kontrollen, og det var min første erfaring med å mestre
teknologi utover det som kan forventes av forbildet mitt. Jeg må ha
vært rundt 12 år og det som skjedde gjorde at jeg begynte å søke etter
å mestre datamaskiner.</p>

<p>Problem was, I was completely on my own.  Since no other kid had a
geeky dad like mine, none of them had a computer.  And just forget
about school teachers back then; computers were totally Science
Fiction (if they were at all familiar with that term).  I was
nevertheless able to teach myself programming in the Basic programming
language just by reading a couple of books and studying programs made
by others.  And I even learned a second language along the way; most
books were written in English.  As the years went by, I was able to
tech myself both assembly, Pascal, C, Perl, and more programming
languages just by reading books.  But it wouldn't have been that easy
if it wasn't for Basic, the language that started it all for me.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the present.  A master degree in Computer Science
and several programming languages have passed.  During my years as a
professional computer programmer, I've met many people with similar
childhoods.  They grew up in the early 1980's home computer boom with
ZX-81, VIC-20, Commodore 64, Oric-1, Dragon 32 and whatnot.  And all
these now grown-ups, once kids, were able to teach themselves
programming without any supervision.  We're a generation of geeks, and
it appears we're the first and only such generation.  You don't see
this kind of kids anymore, at least not in the great numbers from the
early 80's.</p>

<p>I have a couple of kids, both of whom I've shown today's high level
programming languages without luck.  They don't get it.  I have a
couple of theories that would explain why the programmer explosion
died out, one of which we can't do anything about, the other we
hopefully can.</p>

<h2>We Can't do Anything About This</h2>

<p>Kids use computers for playing games.  Period.  Oh, add chatting
nowadays, maybe.  Today's games are not anything like in the early
days.  Today's games contain 3D graphics not unlike special effects in
movies.  Motion capture and all, requiring millions worth of
equipment.  And game music is recorded in studio with world class
orchestra.  You have directors, cut scene editors and, well, most of
the stuff you find in the movie world.  There's no way a lone, geeky
teenager can compete with today's off-the-shelf games.</p>

<p>Not so in the golden days.  After teaching themselves programming for
a few months, most geeks were quite capable of programming games that
could almost compete with the stuff people bought on cassette tapes in
the stores.</p>

<p>We cannot do much about this.  It's evolution, and it is exciting
for those of us who enjoy the modern games.</p>

<h2>What we Can Do Something About</h2>

<p>As the need to create more advanced programs has evolved,
programming languages have evolved in accordance.  The traditional
"Hello, World" program, a program that just displays a greeting, can
no longer be written in just a line of code in most modern
programming languages.  You need to add syntactic sugar that is not
easily understood by beginners.</p>

<p>If we want to raise a new generation of computer geeks, I think we
need to go back to the days when creating simple programs was easy.
We should not have to write ten or twenty lines of code to have
"Hello, World" displayed.  We should not have to know the difference
between integers, real numbers, strings and booleans until we have to.
We should not have to type a cryptic compiler command to have the
program translated, and then another command to have it run.  We
should do as we did in the 1980's: Tell the computer what to do, and
make it do it.</p>

<p>That's the idea behind Basus: Make it simple again.</p>

<p>And with the idea implemented comes the disclaimer: Basus is not a
programming language to stick to.  It's much too simple.  Basus should
be used until there's an understanding of variables, control
statements, sequential execution and such.  Once this threshold is
overcome, the modern geek should move on to a modern programming
language.</p>

<p>In other words: Basus is a tool for introduction to programming,
and that's it.</p>
